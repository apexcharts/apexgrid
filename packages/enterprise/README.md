# apex-grid-enterprise

Pro-licensed enterprise features for [`apex-grid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apex-grid).

`apex-grid-enterprise` extends the community grid and registers as
`<apex-grid-enterprise>`, layering enterprise-only features on top of everything
`apex-grid` already does. Use it as a drop-in replacement for `<apex-grid>`: the
configuration API, theming, and events are identical, plus the additions below.

> Requires a valid license key for production use. Without one, the grid keeps
> working but renders a watermark and logs a console notice. Set a key with
> `ApexGridEnterprise.setLicense(...)`; see [Licensing](#licensing) below.

## Enterprise features

- **[Column aggregations](#column-aggregations)**: sum / avg / min / max / count per column.
- **[Row grouping](#row-grouping)**: collapsible groups, nested to any depth, with live per-group subtotals.
- **[Pivoting](#pivoting)**: reshape rows into a cross-tab with aggregated cells.
- **[Set filter](#set-filter)**: Excel-style column value checklist with search and select-all.
- **[Columns tool panel](#columns-tool-panel)**: drag-and-drop panel for visibility, ordering, grouping, and pivot.
- **[Cell range selection & status bar](#cell-range-selection--status-bar)**: Excel-style range select with live aggregates.
- **[Excel (XLSX) export](#excel-xlsx-export)**: native-typed `.xlsx` export plus a toolbar menu entry.
- **[Master / detail grids](#master--detail-grids)**: embed a child grid in each expandable row.
- **[Integrated charts](#integrated-charts)**: render the grid's data as an ApexCharts chart, live-bound to the view (redraws on sort / filter / edit), with a data-mapping definition, a format popover (colors, number format, axis titles, trend / reference lines & bands, forecasting), image export, save / restore, and optional chart-driven cross-filtering.
- **[Context menu](#context-menu)**: right-click or the header kebab button for sort / pin / hide / group / copy, a "Chart range" submenu, and custom items.
- **[Infinite (server-side) row model](#infinite-server-side-row-model)**: stream large remote datasets, block by block.
- **[AI Toolkit](#ai-toolkit)**: natural-language grid control and read-only Q&A on a built-in deterministic rule engine (offline, no key), with optional LLM escalation and a first-class Claude reasoner included.
- **[Formulas](#formulas)**: spreadsheet-style cell formulas with relative/absolute A1 references, drag-to-fill, editor autocomplete and click-to-insert, a broad built-in function set (plus custom functions), dependency-graph recalculation, a show-formulas view, and formula-aware export.

## Install

```bash
npm install apex-grid-enterprise apex-grid lit
```

`apex-grid` and `lit` are peer dependencies shared with the community package:
install a single copy of each.

[`apexcharts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apexcharts) is an **optional** peer
dependency, used only by the integrated charts (`renderChart()`). It is loaded
through a dynamic `import()`, so a grid that never charts neither bundles nor
downloads it. Install it only when you chart:

```bash
npm install apexcharts
```

Both ApexCharts **5.x and 6.x** are supported (peer range `^5.15.0 || ^6.0.0`);
a single copy serves the grid's integrated charts and any charts you draw
yourself with `apexcharts` / `react-apexcharts`.

## Usage

```ts
import 'apex-grid-enterprise/define'; // registers the enterprise element set
```

`/define` is the batteries-included entry: it opts the grid into **every**
built-in feature module and registers the grid plus its companion elements
(`<apex-grid-enterprise>`, `<apex-grid-tool-panel>`, `<apex-grid-status-bar>`,
`<apex-grid-set-filter>`). The configuration API is identical to `apex-grid`;
see the [`apex-grid` README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apex-grid) for column
configuration, theming, and events.

### Composing only the features you use

Importing from the package root wires in **no** feature modules by default, so
each one is tree-shaken unless you opt into it via `ApexGridEnterprise.use()`.
Call it once at startup, before registering the element:

```ts
import { ApexGridEnterprise, pivotModule, rangeSelectionModule } from 'apex-grid-enterprise';

ApexGridEnterprise.use(pivotModule, rangeSelectionModule); // only these are bundled + wired
ApexGridEnterprise.register();
```

Available modules: `aggregationModule`, `groupingModule`, `pivotModule`,
`rangeSelectionModule`, `contextMenuModule`, `formulaModule`. The
`enterpriseModules` array is the full set (it is what `/define` passes to
`use()`). Modules a grid is not opted into add nothing to your bundle.

---

## Column aggregations

Request sum / avg / min / max / count per column via the `aggregations` property,
then read the computed values with `getAggregations()`:

```ts
grid.aggregations = { price: ['sum', 'avg'], sold: ['sum', 'max'] };

const totals = grid.getAggregations();
// → { price: { sum: 657.92, avg: 109.65 }, sold: { sum: 347, max: 91 } }
```

`AggregationConfig` is `Record<string, AggregationFn[]>`, where `AggregationFn` is
`'sum' | 'avg' | 'min' | 'max' | 'count'`. Non-numeric values are ignored. The
same engine powers group subtotals and pivot cells, so numbers are computed
consistently everywhere.

### Grand-total row

`totalRow` adds one synthesized row showing aggregations across the whole view:

```ts
grid.totalRow = { aggregations: { price: ['sum'], sold: ['sum'] } };
grid.getTotals(); // → { price: { sum: 657.92 }, sold: { sum: 347 } }
```

This is not the same thing as the per-group aggregates `groupBy` renders, which
total a group's own leaves. The total row totals the *view*, so it answers "what
is the sum of this column" without grouping anything, and it follows filtering —
a filtered grid totals what it shows. In a grouped view the group-header rows are
excluded, so their aggregates are not counted twice.

`position: 'top'` moves it above the rows, `label` overrides the leading text
(default: the localized "Grand Total"), and `null` removes it. Style it through
the `total-row`, `total-row-content`, `total-row-label`, `total-row-values`, and
`total-row-value` parts. Pivot brings its own grand total, so this covers the
flat and grouped views.

## Row grouping

Group rows by one or more columns. Group headers render full-width with a chevron
toggle, a leaf count, and inline subtotals. Aggregates are computed over the
**filtered** leaves, so they track what is on screen.

```ts
grid.groupBy = ['region', 'department'];          // ordered; [] = no grouping
grid.aggregations = { salary: ['sum', 'avg'] };   // shown on each group header
grid.groupingOptions = { defaultExpanded: true }; // true | false | depth number

grid.expandAllGroups();
grid.collapseAllGroups();
grid.expandGroup('/EMEA/Engineering');            // stable path key
grid.getGroups();                                 // GroupRowMeta<T>[]
```

Cancellable `groupExpanding` and follow-up `groupExpanded` events fire on toggle.

## Pivoting

Reshape data into a cross-tab: pick the row dimension(s), the column(s) to pivot
on, and the measures aggregated into each cell. Pivot columns are generated from
the data and recompute on filter. Pivoting and `groupBy` are mutually exclusive
(pivot wins).

```ts
grid.pivotRows = ['region'];            // down the left
grid.pivotOn = 'department';            // its distinct values become columns
grid.pivotValues = { salary: ['sum'] }; // measure(s) per cell (AggregationConfig)

grid.pivotOn = '';                      // disable, restoring the original columns
```

`grid.isPivoting` reflects whether a pivot view is currently active.

### Spanning headers, totals, and multi-field column dimensions

With more than one measure, or more than one column-dimension field, the value
columns group under **spanning headers**. `pivotOn` accepts an ordered list; the
first field heads the spanning group (core column groups are one level deep, so
inner fields fold into the leaf header). `getPivotColumnGroups()` returns the
generated groups.

`pivotOptions` adds **subtotals** (a row after each first-dimension value; needs
a multi-field row dimension) and a **grand total**:

```ts
grid.pivotRows = ['region', 'department'];
grid.pivotOn = ['level', 'quarter'];      // multi-field column dimension
grid.pivotValues = { salary: ['sum', 'avg'] };
grid.pivotOptions = { subtotals: true, grandTotal: 'bottom' };
```

Total rows are ordinary rows carrying the aggregate; `getPivotMeta(row)` returns
`{ kind: 'subtotal' | 'grandTotal' }` for them (and `'data'` otherwise), so you
can style or skip them. Both totals are off unless requested.

### Expandable row groups

`pivotOptions.expandable` renders the row dimension as a nested, collapsible tree:
the per-field leading columns collapse into one auto group column with indentation
and chevrons, and each parent row carries the aggregate over its subtree.

```ts
grid.pivotRows = ['region', 'department'];
grid.pivotOn = 'level';
grid.pivotValues = { salary: ['sum'] };
grid.pivotOptions = { expandable: true, defaultExpanded: true, grandTotal: 'bottom' };
```

`defaultExpanded` accepts `true` / `false` / a depth threshold. Clicking a chevron
toggles a node; total rows still compose. In expandable mode the `subtotals` option
is ignored (parent rows already are the subtotals).

## Set filter

An Excel-style value checklist for a column. A standalone companion element wired
to the grid; every toggle applies immediately and composes with the grid's other
filters.

```html
<apex-grid-set-filter id="filter" column="department"></apex-grid-set-filter>
```

```ts
filter.grid = grid;                 // required
await filter.updateComplete;
filter.setSelectedTokens(['Engineering', 'Marketing']);

filter.selectAll();                 // select all values (clears the column filter)
filter.clearAll();                  // deselect all (hides every row)
filter.refresh();                   // re-read distinct values after data changes
filter.distinctValues;              // ReadonlyArray<{ token, value, label }>
filter.selectedTokens;              // string[]
```

The panel includes a search box, a `(Select all)` row, and folds empty values
(`null` / `undefined` / `''`) into a single entry. CSS parts are exposed for
styling.

## Advanced filter builder

A nested **AND / OR** visual query builder — beyond the per-column header filters.
Compose conditions and sub-groups like `(region = EMEA OR region = AMER) AND salary > 80000`.

```html
<apex-grid-filter-builder id="builder"></apex-grid-filter-builder>
```

```ts
builder.grid = grid;                // required
// Add conditions / groups in the UI, then Apply. Or drive it headlessly:
grid.applyAdvancedFilter({
  kind: 'group',
  join: 'and',
  children: [
    {
      kind: 'group',
      join: 'or',
      children: [
        { kind: 'condition', column: 'region', operator: 'equals', value: 'EMEA' },
        { kind: 'condition', column: 'region', operator: 'equals', value: 'AMER' },
      ],
    },
    { kind: 'condition', column: 'salary', operator: 'greaterThan', value: 80000 },
  ],
});
grid.clearAdvancedFilter();         // remove it
grid.advancedFilterModel;           // the active model, or null
```

Operators come from the same operand tables as the header filters
(`operatorsForType(type)`), so semantics match. Evaluation is client-side via the
`dataPipelineConfiguration.filter` hook and composes with sort / pagination /
grouping. While active, the advanced filter **owns** column filtering (it replaces
the built-in filter). The model is plain JSON, so it round-trips through storage.
The pure evaluator (`filterRows`, `isEmptyModel`) is exported for headless use.

## Columns tool panel

A drag-and-drop side panel that turns the advanced features into a no-code
surface: toggle column visibility, pin, reorder, and search; drag fields into
**Row Groups** / **Values** to group and aggregate; flip **Pivot mode** to drive
pivot rows, values, and column labels. Wire it to a grid and it drives the grid's
public properties directly.

```html
<apex-grid-tool-panel id="panel"></apex-grid-tool-panel>
```

```ts
document.getElementById('panel').grid = grid; // the only wiring needed
```

## Cell range selection & status bar

Excel-style cell range selection is on by default; pair it with the status bar
companion element to show live aggregates (count / sum / avg / min / max) over
the current selection. Holding a drag at the top or bottom edge of the grid
body auto-scrolls and keeps extending the selection past the visible rows.

```html
<apex-grid-status-bar id="status"></apex-grid-status-bar>
```

```ts
status.grid = grid;

grid.rangeSelection = true;         // default; HTML attribute: range-selection
grid.selectRange(/* start, end */); // programmatic selection
// the grid emits 'apex-range-changed' with the current selection stats
```

## Excel (XLSX) export

Export to a real `.xlsx` file where numbers, booleans, and `Date` values keep
their native Excel cell types. Adds an "Export XLSX" entry to the toolbar's
export menu, alongside the community grid's CSV (CSV export stays free).

```ts
const bytes = grid.exportToXLSX({ filename: 'users', sheetName: 'Users' });
// options: { filename?, sheetName?, source?, columns? }, returns Uint8Array
```

## Master / detail grids

Give each expandable row its own embedded child grid. Provide the child columns
and a (sync or async) data getter; detail grids are cached per row.

```ts
grid.masterDetail = {
  columns: [{ key: 'sku' }, { key: 'qty' }],       // or a (row) => columns fn
  getDetailData: (row) => fetchOrderLines(row.id),  // T[] | Promise<T[]>
  detailHeight: 240,                                // optional
};

grid.refreshDetail(row); // drop a row's cached detail grid to force a reload
```

## Integrated charts

Render the grid's current data as an ApexCharts chart. ApexCharts is dynamically
imported, so it only loads when a chart is actually drawn.

The chart model is derived by intent: a selected **cell range** wins, otherwise the
current **view** (the flat grid, or a grouping/pivot aggregate). Friendly chart types
(`column`, `bar`, `line`, `area`, `pie`, `donut`, `scatter`, `radar`, `combo`, or
`'auto'`) map to the right ApexCharts shape.

```ts
const model = grid.getRangeChartModel();     // from the active cell selection
// or grid.getViewChartModel()               // from the current view (flat, or grouping/pivot)
// or grid.getChartModel()                   // selection if present, else view

const chart = grid.createRangeChart(container, {
  type: 'column',
  apexOptions: { /* deep-merged escape hatch */ },
});
```

Each getter takes an optional [`ChartDefinition`](#data-mapping) to control which
column is the category, which are the measures, and how rows are aggregated per
category.

### `<apex-grid-chart>` panel

A built-in chart panel with a type gallery that **live-redraws** as the selection or
view changes. Set its `grid` property; choose `mode="inline"` (embedded) or
`mode="dialog"` (a floating, draggable panel, the default). It renders in light DOM
(ApexCharts cannot render inside a shadow root).

```html
<apex-grid-chart mode="inline"></apex-grid-chart>
```

```ts
chart.grid = grid;
chart.source = 'selection'; // 'auto' (default) | 'selection' | 'view'
chart.type = 'column';      // gallery-switchable; 'auto' uses the recommended type
chart.theme = 'grid';       // 'grid' (sync palette to grid theme) | 'light' | 'dark'
```

With `source="view"` the panel becomes a **live companion**: it charts the whole
current view and redraws automatically as you sort, filter, or edit the grid, with no
cell selection required.

The enterprise grid also adds a **"Create chart"** toolbar button that opens the
panel in a dialog. Each click mints an **independent** chart panel, so several charts
(each a frozen snapshot of the data at creation) can sit side by side without
disturbing one another. The panel and toolbar button require `<apex-grid-chart>` to be
registered (the `/define` entry does this for you).

Ways to start a chart, and a few panel niceties:

- **On a selection** a floating **Chart** button appears over the grid, and **Alt+F1**
  charts the current cell range from the keyboard.
- **On a grouped / pivoted view** the right-click menu offers **"Chart this view"**
  (it charts the group/pivot model); with a plain selection it offers **"Chart range"**.
- The type gallery is grouped (cartesian / circular / statistical) with an icon per
  type; **Auto** is a "Suggested" badge. A dialog chart's heading **auto-titles** from
  the mapping ("Revenue by Region") and is **double-click-to-rename**.

### Data mapping

`ChartDefinition` (the panel's `definition` property, or an argument to the model
getters) controls how the grid maps to the chart. Every field is optional: the empty
default keeps the automatic mapping (first non-numeric column is the category, every
numeric column a series, summed per category), so a mapping UI can seed itself from the
default and override only what changes.

```ts
chart.definition = {
  category: 'region',            // column key for the X axis
  measures: ['revenue', 'deals'],// column keys plotted as series
  aggregation: 'sum',            // 'sum' | 'avg' | 'count' | 'min' | 'max' | 'median'
                                 // (or a per-measure map { revenue: 'sum', deals: 'avg' })
  secondaryMeasures: ['deals'],  // draw these on a secondary (opposite) value axis
};
```

The panel surfaces all of this in a **Data** popover in the toolbar: a category
picker, a checkbox per numeric column (with a per-series **2nd axis** toggle for
measures on a different scale, e.g. revenue vs. headcount), and the aggregation. The
columns it offers come from `grid.getChartFields()` (`{ key, label, numeric }[]`), so a
custom mapping UI can read the same list. The popover is hidden for snapshot charts
(`staticModel`) and while grouping/pivot is active (those views carry their own
aggregation).

### Calculated fields

A **calculated field** plots a series from a formula over the other columns, with no
extra grid column. The formula uses the enterprise formula engine with **A1**
references, where the letters map to the numeric columns in display order (`A1` = first
numeric column, `B1` = second, …; row is always `1` — one aggregated value per column
per category):

```ts
chart.definition = {
  category: 'department',
  measures: ['salary'],
  calculatedFields: [{ name: 'Bonus %', formula: 'B1 / A1 * 100' }], // bonus / salary * 100
  secondaryMeasures: ['Bonus %'], // a calc field can sit on the secondary axis (by its name)
};
```

Each field is evaluated **per category over the aggregated values** (aggregate-then-
evaluate, i.e. the ratio of totals — the convention in Excel PivotTable calculated
fields, Power BI measures, and Tableau). The Data popover has an editor (name + a
live-validated formula input with an `A1 = column` legend); calc fields ride through
`toJSON` / `restore` in the definition. `isValidChartFormula(formula)` and
`computeCalculatedSeries(...)` are exported for building your own UI.

### Format popover

The toolbar's **Format** popover surfaces the handful of options users change most
often, layered over `apexOptions` so it only touches the keys you set. All are
available programmatically via the `format` property (`ChartFormat`):

```ts
chart.format = {
  colors: ['#2563eb', '#16a34a'], // per-series, in series order
  legend: true,
  dataLabels: false,
  gridlines: true,
  numberFormat: 'currency',       // 'none' | 'currency' | 'percent' | 'thousands'
  axisTitles: { x: 'Department', y: 'Salary (USD)' },
  referenceLine: 100_000,         // dashed target/threshold on the value axis
  referenceBand: { from: 80_000, to: 100_000 }, // shaded target range
  trendline: true,                // least-squares trend overlay on the first series
  forecast: 3,                    // project N future periods as a continuation line
  forecastBand: true,             // add a ~95% prediction band around the forecast
};
```

`trendline`, `forecast`, and `forecastBand` are also exposed as the pure functions
`linearTrend()`, `linearForecast()`, and `linearForecastBand()`, and `ChartFormat` ↔
ApexCharts translation as `formatToApexOptions()`, so you can drive them without the
panel.

### Export

The toolbar's **Export** menu (and the matching methods) save the chart as a raster
**PNG**, a scalable **SVG**, or copy it to the clipboard as an image:

```ts
await chart.exportImage('png'); // or 'svg'
await chart.copyImage();        // PNG to the clipboard
```

### Save & restore

`toJSON()` returns a plain-JSON `ChartConfig` (type, source, mapping, format, heading,
cross-filter, and any frozen snapshot) that an app can persist anywhere and reapply
with `restore()`. `apexOptions` is excluded (it is author code and may hold functions),
so bind it and `grid` separately.

```ts
const config = chart.toJSON();            // JSON-safe; JSON.stringify(chart) works too
localStorage.setItem('myChart', JSON.stringify(config));

// later
chart.grid = grid;
chart.restore(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('myChart')!));
```

### Cross-filtering

Set `cross-filter` (the attribute or the `crossFilter` property) to turn the panel
into a filter surface: clicking a chart segment filters the underlying grid rows to
that category, and clicking it again toggles the filter off. The chart reads the
grid's **full, unfiltered** data, so every category stays on the chart instead of
collapsing to the filtered subset.

```html
<apex-grid-chart cross-filter></apex-grid-chart>
```

```ts
chart.crossFilter = true;
chart.selectCategory(0); // programmatic form of clicking the first segment
```

The filter is applied with a self-contained, **type-independent** equality operation
(a `logic` predicate rather than a named operand), so it matches regardless of the
category column's declared type. Turning `crossFilter` off (or disconnecting the
panel) drops any filter it applied.

## Context menu

A right-click **context menu** on cells and column headers, also opened from each
column header's kebab (three-dot) button so the actions are discoverable without a
right-click. The kebab and the right-click menu show the same items. Enabled by
default; set `context-menu="false"` (the attribute) to turn it off, or assign a
`ContextMenuConfig` (via the `contextMenu` property) to replace the items.

```ts
grid.contextMenu = false; // disable

grid.contextMenu = {      // or replace the items
  items: (target) => [
    { id: 'sort-asc', label: 'Sort ascending', run: () => grid.sort([{ key: target.column.key, direction: 'ascending' }]) },
    { id: 'copy', label: 'Copy', separatorBefore: true, run: (t) => copyCell(t) },
  ],
};
```

`ContextMenuConfig<T>` is `{ items?: ContextMenuItem<T>[] | ((target: ContextMenuTarget<T>) => ContextMenuItem<T>[]) }`,
where a `ContextMenuItem<T>` is `{ id, label, run?, disabled?, submenu?, separatorBefore? }`
(provide a `submenu` for a nested menu, or a `run` callback for a leaf). The `target`
is `{ kind: 'cell' | 'header', column, row?, rowIndex? }`.

The built-in default items are **sort ascending / descending / clear sort**, **pin to
start / pin to end / unpin**, **hide column**, and (on cell targets) **copy**. On header
targets, when the grouping module is present, the menu also offers **group by this
column**, **un-group all**, and **expand / collapse all groups**. When you leave
`contextMenu` at its default (rather than supplying your own `items`), the menu also
appends a **"Chart range"** submenu whose entries (Column, Bar, Line, Area, Pie, Donut,
Combo, Auto) chart the current cell-range selection in the chart dialog.

To tweak the items per target without replacing the whole set, listen for the
cancellable `apex-context-menu-opening` event: its `detail.items` array is prefilled
with the resolved items (the defaults, unless you supplied your own) and is mutable, so
you can push, splice, or `preventDefault()` before the menu opens.

```ts
grid.addEventListener('apex-context-menu-opening', (event) => {
  event.detail.items.push({ id: 'custom', label: 'My action', separatorBefore: true, run: () => {} });
});
```

The feature is the `contextMenuModule` (id `context-menu`); the `/define` entry
includes it.

## Infinite (server-side) row model

Stream large remote datasets without loading every row into memory. The grid
fetches fixed-size blocks on scroll and delegates sort, filter, and quick-search
to your backend.

```ts
grid.infiniteRowModel = {
  datasource: {
    async getRows({ startRow, endRow, sortModel, filterModel, quickFilter }) {
      const { rows, total } = await fetchPage(startRow, endRow, sortModel, filterModel, quickFilter);
      return { rows, rowCount: total }; // omit rowCount for "infinite" mode
    },
  },
  blockSize: 100, // default 100
};

grid.isRowLoading(row); // true for not-yet-loaded placeholder rows (render skeletons)
grid.refreshRows();     // refetch after a server-side mutation
```

The grid emits `apex-rows-loaded` (`detail: { rowCount, exact, loadedBlocks,
blockSize }`) so you can show live load status.

### Server-side grouping + aggregation

For the analytics case, `serverSideRowModel` groups and aggregates **on the
server**: the grid asks for one group level at a time and lazily fetches a
group's children when it is expanded. Group rows show server-computed aggregates
under an auto group column.

```ts
grid.serverSideRowModel = {
  datasource: {
    async getRows({ groupKeys, rowGroupCols, valueCols, sortModel, filterModel, quickFilter }) {
      // groupKeys is the value path of the parent being expanded ([] = top level).
      // Return group rows (with the grouped value + aggregates) when
      // groupKeys.length < rowGroupCols.length, else the leaf rows.
      return { rows: await fetchLevel(groupKeys, rowGroupCols, valueCols, sortModel, filterModel, quickFilter) };
    },
  },
  rowGroupCols: ['region', 'department'],
  valueCols: { salary: ['sum'] },
};

grid.expandServerGroup(['EMEA']);          // programmatic expand/collapse
grid.collapseServerGroup(['EMEA']);
grid.refreshServerSide();                  // reload after a server-side mutation
grid.isServerSideRowModel;                 // boolean
```

Group rows carry `aria-level` / `aria-expanded` for screen readers. The grid
emits `apex-server-rows-loaded`. Mutually exclusive with `infiniteRowModel` and
client `groupBy` / `pivotOn` (the server owns shaping).

**Server-side pivot.** Add `pivotCols` to pivot on the server: the grid passes
`pivotCols` + `pivotMode` to `getRows`, and the server returns the generated
value columns in `pivotResultFields` (plus optional `pivotResultGroups` for
spanning headers), which the grid installs.

```ts
grid.serverSideRowModel = {
  datasource,
  rowGroupCols: ['region'],
  pivotCols: ['department'],       // ⇒ pivotMode; server returns pivotResultFields
};
```

**Intra-group pagination.** By default a group's children load in one request.
Set `blockSize` to load them a window at a time: the grid passes `startRow` /
`endRow` to `getRows`, sizes the group from the returned `rowCount`, renders
not-yet-loaded rows as placeholders, and fetches the next block as you scroll
into it. Use `grid.isRowLoading(row)` to detect a placeholder (e.g. for a
skeleton).

```ts
grid.serverSideRowModel = {
  datasource,                      // getRows now receives { startRow, endRow, ... }
  rowGroupCols: ['region', 'department'],
  valueCols: { salary: ['sum'] },
  blockSize: 100,                  // children fetched 100 at a time; return `rowCount`
};
```

## AI Toolkit

Drive the grid in natural language. A prompt becomes a schema-validated state
change applied through `setState()` with a one-click undo, plus a read-only Q&A
mode. By default it runs on a **built-in deterministic rule engine**: offline, no
key, no network. You can add an optional LLM (a first-class Anthropic/Claude
reasoner is included) that the grid escalates to only when the rule engine is not
confident. The whole toolkit is an enterprise feature; it builds on the community
grid's `getSchema()` / `setState()` foundation.

### What it understands

The rule engine covers a documented set of commands and questions. Use these and
they work instantly and offline; anything outside the set escalates to your LLM
reasoner (if you configured one) or is reported honestly (see below). It never
guesses silently.

- **Sort:** "sort by revenue, highest first", "order by name", "reverse the sort".
- **Group / ungroup:** "group by region", "ungroup".
- **Filter:** "filter status = open", "only show EMEA", "remove rows where salary
  is under 70000", "keep only rows with amount over 100". Removal keeps the
  complement (it inverts the operand, or reports that it cannot).
- **Columns:** "hide the notes column", "show salary", "pin name to the left".
- **Search:** "search Acme".
- **Pivot / aggregate:** "pivot on region", "sum of revenue".
- **Pagination / export:** "page 2", "page size 50", "export as csv".
- **Reset / undo:** "reset", "undo".
- **Read-only questions:** "how many rows", "highest / lowest / average salary",
  "min, max and median of bonus", "average salary by department", "who has the
  highest salary", "top 5 by revenue", "which region has the highest total sales".

Compound requests are supported in one sentence: "group by department, then sort
by salary and remove all rows under 70000" applies three steps atomically with a
single undo.

### Running a prompt

```ts
const result = await grid.runPrompt('group by region, then sort by revenue, highest first');
if (result.mode === 'control') {
  console.log(result.applied);  // e.g. ['group', 'sort']
  console.log(result.warnings); // anything dropped or unmapped, each with a reason
  result.undo();                // one-click revert
}

// Read-only question; the grid is not changed.
const answer = await grid.runPrompt('which region has the highest average revenue?', { mode: 'ask' });
// answer.mode === 'ask'; answer.answer is the text reply
```

`runPrompt` validates every planned change against the schema (dropping anything
out of vocabulary, with a reported reason), applies it via the defensive
`setState()`, and returns an idempotent `undo()` that restores the prior
snapshot. Ask mode never mutates the grid.

### Honest fallback (no silent no-ops)

When a prompt cannot be mapped to a grid action and no LLM reasoner is
configured, `runPrompt` **abstains** rather than silently doing nothing or
guessing:

```ts
const result = await grid.runPrompt('teleport the widget sideways');
// result.mode === 'ask', result.abstained === true
// result.answer is a short "I could not turn that into a grid action" note
```

The panel renders this as a distinct message (with a hint) instead of an empty
result. Confidence is calibrated on how much the prompt actually grounds against
your schema, so a near-miss command scores low and either escalates to your LLM
reasoner or abstains, instead of returning a confident wrong answer.

### Optional LLM escalation

Leave `runPrompt` as is for the offline rule engine. To also handle prompts the
rules cannot map, assign a `Reasoner`. The grid tries the rule engine first and
escalates only when it is unsure, so simple requests stay instant and offline.

```ts
import { createClaudeReasoner, createLLMReasoner } from 'apex-grid-enterprise';

// Production: your backend holds the key and calls Anthropic; the browser never sees it.
grid.aiReasoner = createClaudeReasoner({ endpoint: '/api/grid-ai' });

// Development only: call Anthropic from the browser. This exposes the key to the page.
grid.aiReasoner = createClaudeReasoner({ apiKey: '...', dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true });

// Or bring any provider by implementing a single completion function.
grid.aiReasoner = createLLMReasoner({ complete: async (req) => ({ patch: /* ... */ }) });
```

The Claude direct transport dynamically imports `@anthropic-ai/sdk` (an optional
peer dependency), defaults to `claude-opus-4-8` (configurable), and uses tool use
so the model returns a state patch shaped by the grid's schema (`toJSONSchema`).
The proxy transport POSTs `{ prompt, mode, schema, data }` to your endpoint,
which returns `{ patch?, answer? }`. Prefer the proxy for production. Install the
SDK only when you use the direct transport:

```bash
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk
```

The AI runtime is loaded on demand, on the first `runPrompt` / `previewPrompt`, so
a grid that never runs a prompt bundles none of it.

### Prompt panel

`<apex-grid-ai>` is a ready-made prompt UI. Bind it to a grid and it drives
`runPrompt` for you, showing what changed (with an Undo button), the answer in
ask mode, or the honest fallback when a prompt could not be mapped.

```html
<apex-grid-ai mode="inline"></apex-grid-ai>
```

```ts
document.querySelector('apex-grid-ai').grid = grid;
```

`mode="inline"` renders in place; `mode="dialog"` (the default) is a floating,
draggable panel. The enterprise grid also adds an **"Ask AI"** toolbar button
that opens the panel in a dialog (the `/define` entry registers the element).

### How it stays safe

The control path is guarded in layers: an LLM is constrained by the grid's schema
(`toJSONSchema`), anything out of vocabulary is stripped before it is applied
(each drop reported), the defensive `setState()` drops and reports the rest, and
every change is one click undoable. Ask mode is read-only, and an unmappable
prompt abstains instead of acting.

## Formulas

Spreadsheet-style formulas in a cell. Mark a column `allowFormula` (and
`editable`); a cell whose edited text starts with `=` is parsed, stored, and its
computed result becomes the cell value. Because the value stays canonical in
`row[key]`, sorting, filtering, aggregation, export, and charts all keep working
on the result.

```ts
grid.columns = [
  { key: 'qty', headerText: 'Qty', type: 'number', editable: true },
  { key: 'price', headerText: 'Price', type: 'currency', editable: true },
  { key: 'total', headerText: 'Total', type: 'currency', editable: true, allowFormula: true },
];

// Type "=B1*C1" into a Total cell, or set it programmatically:
grid.setFormula(grid.data[0], 'total', '=B1*C1');
grid.getFormula(grid.data[0], 'total'); // '=B1*C1'
grid.clearFormula(grid.data[0], 'total');
grid.recalculateFormulas();
```

### References (A1 over the data)

Columns map to letters by configuration order (`A` is the first column,
including hidden ones); rows are 1-based over the source `data`. So `B2` is the
second data row, second column. References bind to the data, not the rendered
view, so a formula keeps its meaning across sort, filter, column reorder, and
paging. Ranges (`A1:B3`) expand to value lists for functions.

References are **relative** by default; a `$` fixes an axis (`$A$1` fixes both,
`$A1` the column only, `A$1` the row only). Relative references shift when a
formula is filled or pasted to another cell; absolute axes stay put. A reference
always resolves to a concrete cell, so recalculation itself is unaffected by
relative-ness.

Identity: formula attachment is durable when you set a grid `rowId` (it survives
reload through `getState` / `setState`); without one it is positional.

### Authoring

While editing a formula (after typing `=`):

- **Autocomplete**: typing a function name shows a suggestion list (built-ins +
  your custom functions). Up/Down to move, Enter/Tab or click to accept (inserts
  `NAME()` with the caret between the parentheses), Escape to dismiss.
- **Click-to-insert**: click any grid cell to insert its reference at the caret;
  Shift-click inserts an absolute `$A$1`.
- **Drag-to-insert a range**: press on a cell and drag across the grid to insert
  a live `A1:C3` range reference; a dashed marquee tracks the cells as you drag.
  Clicking again re-picks the reference (replaces it); type an operator to add a
  second one. Escape backs out of a just-picked reference without leaving the edit.
- **F4 absolute/relative**: with the caret on a reference, press F4 to cycle its
  `$` markers: `A1 -> $A$1 -> A$1 -> $A1 -> A1`.

Point-and-click reference entry is **mouse-driven**: while editing, the arrow keys
always move the text caret and never start referencing cells.

**Drag-to-fill and paste** rewrite a formula's relative references by the
row/column delta to the new cell (absolute `$` axes are preserved):

```ts
// Drag the fill handle, or do it in code: copy total[0]'s formula down.
grid.selectRange({ row: 0, column: 'total' });
grid.fillTo({ row: 4, column: 'total' }); // =B1*C1 becomes =B2*C2, =B3*C3, ...
```

Copying a range and pasting it back inside the same grid re-offsets the source
formulas (a plain-text clipboard cannot carry formulas, so cross-app paste stays
literal).

### Reference highlighting

While a formula cell is being edited, every cell the formula references lights up in
the grid, and each distinct reference gets its own color (a small palette cycles), so
`=B2*C2` highlights B2 and C2 differently, spreadsheet-style. The highlight tracks the
text as you type (invalid mid-edit input keeps the last good highlight) and clears when
the editor closes. It is applied as a `data-formula-ref` cell decoration, so you can
theme the colors with CSS.

To make those references easy to read, spreadsheet coordinates (a row-number gutter
plus `A` / `B` / `C` column letters) are shown by **default** for any grid that has
`allowFormula` columns. Reserving the gutter up front means entering a formula never
shifts the layout: the gutter would otherwise pop in on the first edit and nudge every
column. An explicit `coordinateHints` you set afterwards is left untouched.

### Functions

Built in:

- Math: `SUM`, `AVERAGE` (alias `AVG`), `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT`, `COUNTA`, `ROUND`,
  `ROUNDUP`, `ROUNDDOWN`, `ABS`, `MOD`, `POWER`, `SQRT`, `INT`, `SIGN`.
- Logical: `IF`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`.
- Text: `CONCAT` (alias `CONCATENATE`), `LEN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `MID`, `TRIM`,
  `UPPER`, `LOWER`.

Operators: `+ - * / ^ %`, comparisons `= <> < > <= >=`, and text concatenation
with `&`. `IF` short-circuits, so `IF(B1=0, 0, A1/B1)` is safe. Register your own:

```ts
grid.registerFormulaFunction('TAX', (args) =>
  typeof args[0] === 'number' ? args[0] * 0.2 : 0
);
// =TAX(B1)
```

### Error values

Errors are first-class cell values that render as their code and are excluded
from numeric aggregates: `#REF!` (bad reference), `#NAME?` (unknown function),
`#DIV/0!`, `#VALUE!` (type error), and `#CYCLE!` (circular reference). An error
operand propagates.

### Recalculation and persistence

Editing any referenced cell recomputes its dependents in dependency order (a
real dependency graph with cycle detection, not a full sweep); undo or redo of a
value edit recomputes too. Formulas serialize under `modules.enterprise.formulas`
in `getState()` and restore (and recompute) on `setState()`.

### Show formulas

Set `showFormulas` (the `show-formulas` attribute or the property) to display
each `allowFormula` cell's source instead of its computed value, the spreadsheet
"show formulas" view. The computed values are untouched, so turning it off
restores the normal display; a user-provided `cellTemplate` is never overridden.

```ts
grid.showFormulas = true; // reveal sources; set back to false to restore
```

### Export formulas

`exportToCSV` and `exportToXLSX` accept a `formulas` option: when set, cells that
hold a formula export their source (`=A1*B1`) rather than the computed value;
other cells export normally.

```ts
grid.exportToCSV({ filename: 'budget', formulas: true });
grid.exportToXLSX({ filename: 'budget', formulas: true });
```

### Deferred

Range+criteria functions (`SUMIF` / `COUNTIF` / `AVERAGEIF`) need a different
argument-grouping convention and are deferred to a later tier, along with array
formulas and cross-sheet references.

## Licensing

Licensing is offline and non-hostile: without a valid key the grid keeps working
but renders a watermark and logs a console notice, with no network calls and no
hard blocking. Set the key once (globally) before or after the grid renders:

```ts
import { ApexGridEnterprise } from 'apex-grid-enterprise';

ApexGridEnterprise.setLicense('APEX-…'); // removes the watermark on all instances
```

`LicenseManager` (re-exported from `apex-commons`) is also available for advanced
use, but `setLicense` is the supported entry point.

Keys are ECDSA-signed. Verification is asynchronous (WebCrypto has no synchronous
API) while the watermark decision is synchronous, so a structurally valid key is
accepted provisionally and the grid re-checks when the signature verdict settles:
a tampered key lifts the watermark for a microtask and then gets it back. The
overlay itself is `apex-commons`' shared `Watermark`, the same one the other Apex
products paint, and it keeps the `license-watermark` part for styling.
