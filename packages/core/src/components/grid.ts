/**
 * Apex grid is a web component for displaying data in a tabular format quick and easy.
 *
 * Out of the box it provides row virtualization, sort and filter operations (client and server side),
 * the ability to template cells and headers and column hiding.
 *
 * @remarks
 * A working, styled grid requires three things:
 *  1. Register the element: `import 'apex-grid/define'` (or `ApexGrid.register()`).
 *  2. Give the host element a bounded height, e.g. `apex-grid { height: 480px }` —
 *     the virtualizer collapses without one.
 *  3. Do NOT set `display` on the host — the component declares `:host { display: grid }`
 *     internally and any override breaks the track layout.
 *
 * The grid is styled out of the box through `--ag-*` CSS custom properties —
 * there is no theme to import and no `configureTheme()` call. Override `--ag-*`
 * tokens on the host (or any ancestor) to rebrand; where an Ignite UI palette is
 * present, the brand tokens auto-tint from it. For dark mode, set
 * the `theme="dark"` attribute on the host for the built-in slate dark palette
 * (further `--ag-*` overrides still compose on top). Add `tinted` (e.g.
 * `theme="tinted"` or `theme="dark tinted"`) to mix the brand into the chrome
 * so the grid wears its brand even at rest. See the README "Getting Started"
 * and "Theming" sections for the full example and token list.
 *
 * @element apex-grid
 *
 * @attr {string} theme - Space-separated theme flags. `dark` opts into the built-in dark palette; `tinted` mixes `--ag-brand` into the chrome surfaces. Combine as `theme="dark tinted"`.
 *
 * @fires sorting - Emitted when sorting is initiated through the UI.
 * @fires sorted - Emitted when a sort operation initiated through the UI has completed.

 *
 * @cssprop [--ag-brand] - Brand color for selection, focus rings, and accents. Auto-tints from `--ig-primary-500` where an Ignite UI palette is present.
 * @cssprop [--ag-brand-strong] - Brand color for hover / pressed states.
 * @cssprop [--ag-grid-shadow] - Grid edge/shadow override. Default is a flat 1px hairline edge; set to `var(--ag-shadow-card)` for the elevated card look, or `none` to remove it.
 * @cssprop [--ag-grid-bg] - Host card background. Defaults to a subtle light gradient; override with a flat color (or use `theme="dark"`) for dark themes.
 * @cssprop [--ag-surface] - Grid card background (must be opaque).
 * @cssprop [--ag-surface-alt] - Alternating row tint.
 * @cssprop [--ag-surface-elevated] - Header background.
 * @cssprop [--ag-hairline] - Header / structural gridline color.
